Froala -> code editor -> free
ultra edit -> paid software 
VScode -> to write a program code editor is needed -> imagine they're like a notebook to write a code -> freely available by Microsoft 
.html files 
Website frontend consists of three parts/components 1-HTML(provides structure/layout)    2-CSS(provide style)  3-JS(provide logic- it defines functionality)
--------------LEVEL 1---------------------------
----------BASIC INFO------
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the code that is used to structure a webpage and its content 
The components used to design the structure of websites are called HTML tags
install extension -> live server by Ritwick Dey
FIRST HTML FILE index.html (It is the default name for a website's homepage-> server render in browser it detect it by index name) -> programmer's technique (treating it as home page)
.htm to make file (not updated)
! (Emmet Abbreviated is a toolkit. it come by default in vs code -> it gives you many helpful tools)-> this code is called boiler plate code (nor learn neither see)
Hello World is a by default statement that you write while coding as a learner of new programming language
Live server is an extension that helps you to avoid save and refresh or open  again and again
HTML TAGS------------------------
A container for some content or other HTML tags
example: opening                        closing tag
          [<p> (this is a paragraph)->content </p>]-> element
tag + content is called element
HTML provide functionalities of completing these tags itself 
ANALYZING BASIC HTML PAGE---------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>    tells browser you are using HTML5   -> browser take your html code and convert it to webpage/website
<html>             this element tells this is a root(big/initial) of an html document(webpage is itself element)
<head>            container for metadata(information about information) -> tell things for webpage we don't want to display. things that should only be known to our code 
viewport tells that website should be responsive (on phone , ipad ,laptop) when we change aspect ratio (size of a webpage
information that is important but shouldn't be displayed on webpage
</head>
<title> </title> is itself tag in which we write title
<body>            contains all data rendered by the browser. body tag tells things that actually display on our page 
</body>
</html>
not optimum if you miss anything. The benefit of HTML is that you can know about tag by just looking at it. You can also visit mdn reference to know more about these tags.
--------------QUICK POINTS---------------------------
1-Html tag is parent of head and body tag
2-Most of the html elements have opening and  closing tags with content in between
3-Some tags have no content in between eg) <br> used for next line
4-We can use inspect element/view page source to edit html 
shortcut of viewing page source is Ctrl + U
we can edit html from inspect in browser and make changes on browser these changes won't be made on code. The snapshot and practical of this has been added in the picture
----------COMMENTS IN HTML----------------
This is part of code that shouldn't be parsed(mean our browser don't render it). it is not included in code or browser and for developers and only us
short cut is ctrl+/
<!-- This is an HTML Comment -->
-------------------
HTML isn't a case sensitive language like other languages.
<html>  = <HTML>
<p>   =  <P>
<head>  = <HEAD>
<body> = <BODY>
------------------------    LEVEL-2   ----------------------------
----------HTML Attributes-------------
means property associated with tag 
Attributes are used to add more information to the tag 
<html lang='en'> -> language attribute is associated with root html tag 
--------HEADING TAG------------
used to display headings in HTML
always use headings to show importance and not for font size. it may effect SEO ranking if used for font size
h1        most important
h2
h3
h4
h5
h6        least important
------------PARAGRAPH TAG--------------
used to add paragraph in html
<p> This is a sample paragraph </p>
to remove horizontal scroll and split same line into multiple lines to increase readability
select -> setting -> command palette ->view: toggle word wrap
shortcut is Alt + Z 
------------ANCHOR TAG----------
used to add links to your page 
href is an attribute and link is a value
<a href="https://google.com/"> Google </a>   Absolute link -> link of other website
 <a href="index.html">Go to Level-1</a>      Relative link -> link of our own page
----------IMAGE TAG-----------
used to add images to your page
<img src="/image.png" alt="Random Image">
src attribute tells  the relative or absolute url of an image
dimensions of image disturbs when you try to set height and width at the same time. It is advisable in best cases to set one thing at a times
 -> copy img address and paste here . when server is disturbed and image is not load. user must know what was in this img or they don't miss out what's important
  ------BR TAG---------
used to add element in next line (line breaks) to your page

--------------PAGE LAYOUT TECHNIQUES----------
using semantic tags for layout 
semantic tags are those tags from whose name we can understand what's inside these tags.eg- header, footer
benefit -> readable, structured code and improved SEO , good user experience
non-semantic tags are those from which we can't understand what's inside these tags eg- div,span
using the right tags for right things/work
<header>
<main>
<footer>
-----------INSIDE MAIN TAG-------
Section tag-------- used for a section on your page 
<section>
Article tag-------- used for an article on your page
<article>
Aside tag---------- used for content aside main content(ads) -> SEO won't detect it as main content 
<aside>
---------REVISITING ANCHOR TAG---------
FOR NEW TAB-------- opens google in a new tab and that tab is intact
 <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_main">Google</a>  
FOR CLICKABLE PICTURE-------  now on clicking picture new tab'll be opened
 <a href="https://www.google.com/"><img src="link" alt="">Google</a> 
---------REVISITING IMAGE TAG------------
<img src="link" height="50px">    to set height
<img src="link" width=50px>       to set width
widths and heights will be maintained autically as per aspect ratio
--------DIV TAG----------------
Div is a container used for other HTML elements
it hasn't its own work and contain other elements that is why it is called as non-semantic tag.
By default the height of div is set as zero when it has no element
Div is a block Element (takes full width of screen)
For the arrangement of multiple elements div can be used.
LIST OF DIV/BLOCK TAGS------------
<address>  <article>  <aside>  <blockquote>  <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt>  <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer>
<form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video>

</ol>
li stands for list item
to change list type you can visit MDN reference to know more about it
-------------TABLES IN HTML------
Tables are used to represent real life table data.
Table is a semantic tag because from its name we can know that we are going to make a table
<tr> used to display table row 
<td> used to display table data 
<th> used to display table header 
 <!-- -------------CAPTION IN TABLES----------- -->
caption tell what is in the table eg) blood groups
   <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Roll No</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Fateha</th>
                <th>Ali</th>
            </tr>
         </table>

<form> 
form content 
</form>
------ACTION IN FORM------
Action attribute is used to define what action needs to be performed when a form is submitted
<form action="/action.php">
-----FORM ELEMENT: INPUT-------
<input type="text" placeholder="Type something here">
type means what will be written in input (what type of input)
text type would be displayed but password type won't be displayed
placeholder means what'll be written before in input
------------LABEL---------
used to assign tag/name/label to input
1-eyesight weak -> help for screen reader users audio tell here is input field 
2-help for radio buttons 

   <label for="id1">

                <input type="radio" value="class X" name="class" id="id2">
             </label>
value and what we print should be in sync because user can't see value and backend developer can't see print value
 <input type="radio" value="class X" name="class" id="id1"> class XI      is a wrong practice
with the help of label now on clicking text and radio you would be able to check radio buttons, here functionality of label is helpful
